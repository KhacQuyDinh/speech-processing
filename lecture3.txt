#Collect audio Aw for each word w in vocab.
+Apply signal processing => A'w. Called template for word w (Can collect multiple templates for each word).

+Test time: Given audio Atest, Apply signal processingto A'test.

+For each w, compute distance(A'test, A'w) using DTW and 
return w with the smallest distance.

+Complexity: O(states + arc) non linear and quadratic time for dynamic programming.

+Can model longer-distance acoustic dependencies . . .
As compared to conventional GMM/HMM systems. But hasnâ€™t gone anywhere yet.

+basic definition: Distance and Framedist
